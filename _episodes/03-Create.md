# Lesson 3 – Creating metadata

## Tools

There are many tools that can help you to create metadata of which some are freely available on the internet.  The creation tools fall in different catagories:
- Templates:  Allows a user to enter the metadata values into pre-set fields that match the element set being used.  The template will then generate a formatted set of the element attributes and their corresponding values.
- Mark-up tools:  This will structure the metadata atributes and values into the specified schema language.
- Extraction tools:  This will automatically create metadata from an analysis of the digital resource.
- Conversion tools:  Will translate one metadata format to another.

## Standards and schemas

There are various standards and schemas we can use to help us manage metadata.  Here are a few examples of the most commonly used:

- Dublin Core
- EAD
- MARC21
- MODS

There are also various syntaxes where metadata is used:

- XML
- SGML
- MARCXML

## Metadata quality control

Some of the tools used to create metadata can cause errors.  Ensure that quality control measures are in place to correct these errors.

What should propor metadat look like?

- Good metadata should support inter-operability
- It should be appropriate to the materials in the collection, users of the collection and intended, current and likely use of the digital object
- Good metadata uses standard control vocabularies to reflect the what, where, when and who of the content
- It supports longterm management of objects in collections
